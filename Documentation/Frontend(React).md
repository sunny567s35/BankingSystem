# React Frontend Analysis for Banking System 🚀

Here’s an overview of how we’ve implemented the React frontend for our Banking System! 🌟

## React Frontend Overview 📱

We’ve utilized **React** as the frontend framework for our Banking System to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface. Below are the key aspects of our implementation:

- **Reusable JSX Components** ♻️
  - Built modular components for each page (e.g., Home, Dashboard, Login) to keep code clean and manageable. 🧩
  - Ensures consistency and simplifies maintenance across the app. ✅

- **Conditional Rendering Based on Authentication** 🔐
  - Dynamically renders UI based on the user’s authentication state using Django sessions. 🌐
  - Unauthenticated users see only login/registration screens, while logged-in users access protected pages like Dashboard and Transactions. 👀
  - Managed via API calls to Django to check session status, updating the UI in real time. ⚡

- **OTP Verification for Security** 🔒
  - Added an OTP flow as an extra security layer for password resets. 📧
  - Uses separate components with conditional rendering for email input, OTP entry, and password reset steps. 📝
  - Provides a modern, step-by-step user experience with enhanced security. 🛡️

## Professional Implementation Details 📜

As part of our development process, we’ve emphasized a seamless and secure frontend experience. Here’s how we’ve described it:

> "We’ve used React for the frontend of our project. We created reusable JSX components for each page to keep the code clean, modular, and easy to manage. One of the key features in our React frontend is conditional rendering based on the user's authentication state. Since we're using Django sessions, we check whether the user is logged in before displaying certain parts of the UI. For example, unauthenticated users only see the login or registration screens. Once logged in, the UI updates to show the dashboard and other protected pages like transactions, deposit, or transfer. This is handled in React by checking the user’s session status via API calls to Django. Based on the response, we conditionally render the appropriate components. This ensures a smooth user experience while also protecting restricted pages from unauthorized access. So the entire flow is dynamic — the UI adapts in real time based on whether the session is active or not. In addition to session-based authentication, we’ve also implemented OTP verification as an extra layer of security. This entire OTP flow is managed smoothly through React, using separate components and conditional rendering for each step: First, the user enters their email. Then, the OTP input appears if the email is valid. Finally, the password reset form is shown once the OTP is verified. This approach improves security and gives users a step-by-step, guided experience that feels modern and secure."
