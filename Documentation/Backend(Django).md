app = Celery('BankingSystem')
app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')
app.autodiscover_tasks()
```

## üìÑ Other Key Files

- **`__init__.py`**: Imports Celery app to run when Django starts.
- **`wsgi.py`**: Entry point for WSGI servers (e.g., Gunicorn) for deployment.
- **`asgi.py`**: Used for async deployments and WebSockets (e.g., via Daphne/Uvicorn).

## üîÅ 4. Celery Integration

### `celery.py` (in `BankingSystem/`)

- Sets up Celery app and binds Django configuration.
- Uses Redis for broker and result backend.

---

### `tasks.py` (in `app/`)

Contains reusable asynchronous tasks like:

- Sending OTPs
- Triggering emails
- Interest recalculation
- Statement generation in background

```python
from celery import shared_task
from django.core.mail import send_mail

@shared_task
def send_email_task(subject, message, recipient_list):
    send_mail(subject, message, 'noreply@bankingsystem.com', recipient_list)
```
